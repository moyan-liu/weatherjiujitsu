# Weather Jiu-Jitsu: Climate Adaptation for the 21st Century

**Weather Jiu-Jitsu** is a novel research framework that explores how to *gently redirect or deflect* extreme weather ‚Äî such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers ‚Äî through scientifically informed, low-energy interventions in the atmosphere.

## Featured Work
### üìÑ Preprint Papers

- üî¨ **[Weather Jiu-Jitsu: Climate Adaptation for the 21st Century](./publication/wjj-perspective.pdf)**  
  This perspective proposes a new paradigm for climate adaptation. As extreme climate events intensify, traditional infrastructure and mitigation strategies are proving inadequate. We introduce Weather Jiu-Jitsu‚Äîa novel approach that exploits the chaotic dynamics of weather systems to subtly redirect or weaken destructive events using precisely timed, low-energy interventions.

  This vision blends adaptive chaos control theory with advances in observation, forecasting, and intervention technologies, laying the groundwork for a nature-assisted global infrastructure to confront 21st-century climate risks.

- üå™Ô∏è **[Adaptive Chaos Control of Weather Extremes: Demonstrating ‚ÄúWeather Jiu-Jitsu‚Äù in Idealized Models](./publication/control-paper.pdf)**  
  We develop and test an optimal control framework for mitigating extreme weather in simplified atmospheric systems. Using Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 84 models, we show that small perturbations, guided by local Lyapunov exponents and ensemble forecasts, can keep weather trajectories within safe boundaries while minimizing energy use.

  Control strategies are robust to noise and uncertainty, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time adaptive interventions in chaotic systems. These results provide a foundation for scaling Weather Jiu-Jitsu to more realistic atmospheric models.

### üìä Conference Posters & Abstracts

- üìç **[AGU 2024 Poster ‚Äì Investigating Adaptive Chaos Control for Mitigating Weather Extremes](./publication/AGU-poster-2024.pdf)**
  This poster introduces the concept of adaptive chaos control as a potential method for weather modification.

  It explores how small, targeted perturbations‚Äîguided by Lyapunov exponents‚Äîcan influence mid-latitude atmospheric circulation to reduce flood and drought risks. The work proposes a shift from traditional infrastructure toward dynamic interventions.

- üìç **[AGU 2025 Abstracts](./publication/AGU-poster-2025)**  
  Abstracts submitted to AGU 2025 explore Weather Jiu-Jitsu strategies across foundational theory, idealized and DL-based modeling, tropical cyclone and AR control, and seasonal regime dynamics.
  
  PDFs and final posters will be added as acceptance progresses.

    1. **[Weather Jiu Jitsu: A 21st century paradigm to leverage nature's power to mitigate some Compound, Concurrent, and Cascading Weather Hazards in a Changing Climate](./publication/AGU-poster-2025/1.pdf)**
  This talk will outline the potential for using small, strategically timed interventions to steer the atmosphere away from persistent weather regimes that produce compound extremes‚Äîfloods, droughts, heatwaves, and more‚Äîdrawing on idealized models and deep learning emulators to propose a new global-scale mitigation strategy.

    2. **[Steering Tropical Cyclones with Small Perturbations of the Jet Stream in Experiments with Deep Learning Foundation Models](./publication/AGU-poster-2025/2.pdf)**
  Explores the feasibility of shifting tropical cyclone tracks away from vulnerable regions by subtly influencing upstream steering winds using the Aurora deep learning model.

    3. **[Toward Controlling Atmospheric Rivers with Deep Learning Foundation Models and Adaptive Perturbation](./publication/AGU-poster-2025/3.pdf)**
  Applies the Weather Jiu-Jitsu framework to Atmospheric Rivers, using Aurora to identify sensitive spatiotemporal zones where small interventions may redirect AR trajectories pre-landfall.

    4. **[Toward Adaptive Control of Extreme Weather Regimes Using the Seasonally Forced Lorenz-84 Model](./publication/AGU-poster-2025/4.pdf)**
  Extends previous idealized control work to a seasonally forced L84 system, showing that weather regime frequency and intensity can be adaptively modulated using targeted, time-sensitive nudges.

    5. **[Adaptive Chaos Control with Deep Learning of Atmospheric Dynamics to leverage the power of the atmospheric circulation with nudges to move or defuse storms and avert catastrophic flooding](./publication/AGU-poster-2025/5.pdf)**
  Presents Weather Jiu-Jitsu as an alternative to traditional flood infrastructure, exploring how small, well-timed perturbations to atmospheric circulation‚Äîsupported by idealized models and deep learning emulators‚Äîcould reduce the intensity or reroute flood-producing storms to mitigate impacts.
