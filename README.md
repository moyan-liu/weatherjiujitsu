**Weather Jiu-Jitsu** is a novel research framework that explores how to *gently redirect or deflect* extreme weather — such as hurricanes and atmospheric rivers — through scientifically informed, low-energy interventions in the atmosphere.

> “Like martial arts for the atmosphere — using the system’s own chaotic energy against itself.”
